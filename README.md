Browse thousands of games, filter by specific gametypes, maps, and players, and get an in-depth view into each player's score, damage, accuracy, and more!

So, the project is in a pretty good place right now, so I merged my changes from the upgrade-everything branch into the main branch.
Development will continue, but all of the basic features I had in mind are finally done.

LAST DATABASE UPDATE: 4/12/2021
There are currently 9,515 games in the database.

## Documentation 
You can read about the api in the readme [here](./api).

## TODO
* Complete database rehaul ✔️
* Complete frontend rehaul ✔️
* Responsive/mobile-friendly frontend 🟡
* Automatic insertion of recent games into the database (Right now I just run a script manually with match reports given to me by community members) 🔴
